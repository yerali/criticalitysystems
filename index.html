<p >
The success of statistical mechanics in describing different kind of systems from basic but relevant
rules on their microscopic interactions has surpassed the frontier of physics in several attempts to
uncover the relevant local rules that can give rise to complex kinds of phenomena in disciplines like
biology, sociology, and economy among others.  </p >

<p >
One of the most interesting manifestations displayed when using that approach is the absence of a
characteristics scale during some order-disorder transitions. The study of such as phenomena and some
patterns of universality, within the field of Physics, are the subjects of study of the sub-field Critical
phenomena. However, the existence of sings of criticality has been also reported in different areas of
knowledge. The aim of this satellite workshop is to open cross-field discussions about the broad
occurrence of signs of criticality in systems of different nature within the approach of complex systems.

The goal of this satellite is to open cross-disciplinary discussions about the concept of criticality. How can we define criticality in different scenarios? And which signs of criticality have been reported in the scientific literature. We are interested in intersecting different definitions about criticality, but also different meanings with the aims of achieving basic agreements about the signs of criticality, generally speaking. </p >

 <p >The scope of coverage includes:
Any phenomenon presenting signs of criticality, absence of characteristic scale. Theory and/or
observation. </p >
